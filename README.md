# Secure Digital Clock with Alarm Function
## Introduction
This project is a secure digital clock with an alarm function using the VSDSquadron Mini RISC-V development board. It features a keypad for setting the time and alarm, an OLED display for showing the current time, and a buzzer for the alarm. The system includes a basic security feature to ensure that only authorized users can set the time and alarm.
## Overview
The Secure Digital Clock project demonstrates how to use the VSDSquadron Mini RISC-V board to create a functional and secure digital clock. It integrates several peripherals to build a practical application of embedded systems. The added security feature prevents unauthorized changes to the clock settings.
